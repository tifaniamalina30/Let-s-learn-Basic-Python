# Let-s-learn-Basic-Python

Objective Statement 
- Get insight into Dynamic Typing in python programming
-  Get insight into data type conversion in python programming
- Get insight into input, output in Python
- Get insight on what string transformations in python
- Get insight into how the syntax and operations used for string transformations
- Get insight into Replace String Element
- Get insight into the syntax  Replace String Element
- Get insight on what string inspections mean in Python
- Get insight into how the syntax and operations are used for string inspections.
- Get insight into formatting on string
- Get insight into the operation on the list, set, and string in python programming
